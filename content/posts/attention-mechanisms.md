## Introduction & Motivation

Attention mechanisms have revolutionized deep learning, especially in NLP and vision. The core idea is to let models "focus" on the most relevant parts of the input, much like how humans pay attention to key information in a complex scene.

---

## The Intuition: Why Attention?

Imagine reading a long sentence: you don't process every word equally. Instead, you focus on the most relevant words for the current context. Attention mechanisms allow neural networks to do the same.

---

## The Attention Formula

Given a query $Q$, keys $K$, and values $V$:

$$
\text{Attention}(Q, K, V) = \text{softmax}\left(\frac{QK^T}{\sqrt{d_k}}\right)V
$$

where $d_k$ is the dimension of the key vectors.

## Types of Attention

### 1. Self-Attention

Self-attention allows each position in a sequence to attend to all other positions. This is the foundation of the Transformer.

### 2. Multi-Head Attention

Instead of computing a single attention, the model computes multiple "heads" in parallel, each with its own parameters. This allows the model to capture different types of relationships.

$$
\text{MultiHead}(Q, K, V) = \text{Concat}(\text{head}_1, ..., \text{head}_h)W^O
$$


where each head is:

$$
\text{head}_i = \text{Attention}(QW_i^Q, KW_i^K, VW_i^V)
$$

## The Transformer Architecture

The Transformer is built entirely on attention and feed-forward layers, without recurrence or convolution.

![Transformer Architecture](https://jalammar.github.io/images/t/transformer_architecture.png)

- **Encoder**: Stacks of self-attention and feed-forward layers
- **Decoder**: Stacks of self-attention, encoder-decoder attention, and feed-forward layers

---

## Step-by-Step: How Self-Attention Works

1. **Input Embeddings**: Each word is mapped to a vector.
2. **Linear Projections**: For each word, compute query, key, and value vectors.
3. **Attention Scores**: Compute dot products between queries and keys.
4. **Softmax**: Normalize scores to get attention weights.
5. **Weighted Sum**: Multiply attention weights by value vectors and sum.

---

## Mathematical Details

Given input $X \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times d}$:
- $Q = XW^Q$
- $K = XW^K$
- $V = XW^V$

The output is:
$$
\text{softmax}\left(\frac{QK^T}{\sqrt{d_k}}\right)V
$$

---

## Why is Attention Powerful?

- **Parallelization**: Unlike RNNs, attention can be computed in parallel for all positions.
- **Long-Range Dependencies**: Can directly connect distant positions in a sequence.
- **Interpretability**: Attention weights can be visualized to understand model focus.

---

## Limitations & Recent Advances

- **Quadratic Complexity**: Standard attention is $O(n^2)$ in sequence length.
- **Sparse/Linear Attention**: Newer models (e.g., Performer, Longformer) reduce complexity.

---

## Practical Example: PyTorch Self-Attention

```python
import torch
import torch.nn.functional as F

def self_attention(query, key, value, mask=None):
    scores = torch.matmul(query, key.transpose(-2, -1)) / math.sqrt(key.size(-1))
    if mask is not None:
        scores = scores.masked_fill(mask == 0, -1e9)
    attention_weights = F.softmax(scores, dim=-1)
    output = torch.matmul(attention_weights, value)
    return output, attention_weights
```

---

## Visualizing Attention

Attention maps can be visualized to show which words attend to which others. This is useful for interpreting model behavior.

## Conclusion

Attention mechanisms, especially as implemented in the Transformer, have fundamentally changed deep learning. They enable models to process sequences more efficiently and with greater flexibility than ever before.
